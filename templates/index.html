        <h4 class="introduction">&emsp;One of the most interesting yet most obscure government health databases is the United States
           Department of Justice’s National Sex Offender Public Website. A list of offenders with past offenses, the purpose of 
           the data source is to allow the public to protect themselves and their children. The purpose of this project was to utilize a Kaggle dataset 
           on all sex offenders that are registered within the Washington D.C. area that pulls data from the DOJ’s National Sex Offender 
           Public Website to create a comprehensive set of data visualizations, including classification type and coordinates
            of their whereabouts.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our targeted objectives were to create a dynamic dashboard with a map showing coordinates of filtered offenders, 
            a line chart with dates of added offenders, and a bar chart of the different offense types by Zip Code, as well as a system for filtering
            by ZIP Code for all three visualizations. A table of relevant information can be found by clicking on the <i>Data</i> tab in the Navigation Bar.
          <br>
          <br>
          The full DC Sex Offender Registry dataset can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/karnikakapoor/sex-offender-registry">here</a>.

          marker cluster represents a number of offenders in that area, and each marker, when selected, will show comprehensive information on
          the name as well as a few of the physical traits of each particular offender.

          This line chart was constructed using Chart.js to visualize the different registration dates of all recorded offenders in the 
        dataset. Each line represents a different year, and each point represents the number of offenders that were registered for that month.
        Clicking on a particular year on the legend removes or adds that year from the graph, allowing a more isolated visualization for 
        a particular subset of years.</p>

          or found not guilty by reason of insanity of a myriad of sexual offenses that can be found <a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/service/offender-classifications">here</a>.
